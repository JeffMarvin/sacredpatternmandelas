This overlapping of the two equal circles creates a figure of profound and universal symbolism. It represents the union of heaven and earth, spirit and matter, conscious and unconscious. It is associated with Christ and the early symbol of fish in Christianity, and can be seen as bringing spirit or the unseen, into our material world.',

It is a geometrical shape made up of 37 overlapping circles of the same size, and is the primary generator of all physical form. The oldest depiction of the Flower of Life known to man is at the temple of Osiris in Abydod, Egypt. Leonardo DaVinci studied its form and mathematical properties and was interested in how it connected to physical reality as well as consciousness. The Golden Ratio of Phi can also be derived from the flower of life pattern.',
